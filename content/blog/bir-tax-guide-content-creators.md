# BIR Tax Guide for Filipino Content Creators

If you earn money from TikTok, YouTube, Instagram, or any other platform, the BIR considers you a self-employed individual. That means you have tax obligations — but don't worry, it's simpler than you think.

## Do I Need to Register with the BIR?

**Yes.** If you regularly earn income from content creation, you should register as a self-employed professional or sole proprietor with the BIR. This applies whether you receive payments through GCash, Maya, bank transfers, or brand deal checks.

## Step-by-Step: BIR Registration

1. **Get a TIN** — Visit your local BIR Revenue District Office (RDO) or apply online through the eREG system
2. **Fill out BIR Form 1901** — Registration form for self-employed individuals
3. **Get your Certificate of Registration (COR)** — This lists the taxes you need to file
4. **Register your books of accounts** — Can be manual or digital (spreadsheets count!)

Note: The ₱500 annual registration fee was abolished under RA 11976 (Ease of Paying Taxes Act) effective January 2024. You no longer need to pay this.

## 8% Flat Tax vs Graduated Tax: Which Should You Choose?

This is the biggest decision for creators. Here's a quick comparison:

### 8% Flat Tax Rate

- Pay 8% of your **gross income** minus ₱250,000
- Replaces both income tax and percentage tax
- No need to track expenses in detail
- Best for: Creators with **low expenses** relative to income

### Graduated Tax Rate

- Tax rate ranges from 0% to 35% depending on your taxable income
- You can deduct the 40% Optional Standard Deduction (OSD) from gross income
- You also pay 3% percentage tax quarterly
- Best for: Creators with **high expenses** (equipment, studio, travel, etc.)

### Quick Example

Say you earn ₱500,000 per year from content creation:

**8% Flat Tax:**
- Taxable: ₱500,000 - ₱250,000 = ₱250,000
- Tax: ₱250,000 × 8% = **₱20,000**

**Graduated + OSD:**
- After 40% OSD: ₱500,000 × 60% = ₱300,000
- Income tax (TRAIN brackets): ₱300,000 - ₱250,000 = ₱50,000 × 15% = **₱7,500**
- Plus 3% percentage tax: ₱500,000 × 3% = **₱15,000**
- Total: **₱22,500**

In this case, the two options are close (₱20,000 vs ₱22,500). The 8% flat rate is only available if your gross income doesn't exceed ₱3 million per year. Use MoneyGlow's tax estimator to compare!

## Key Tax Deadlines

| Deadline | What to File |
|----------|-------------|
| April 15 | Annual Income Tax Return (BIR Form 1701) |
| Every quarter | Quarterly Income Tax (BIR Form 1701Q) |
| Every quarter | Percentage Tax (BIR Form 2551Q) — if graduated |

## Tips for Creator Tax Filing

- **Keep receipts for everything** — equipment, internet bills, props, editing software
- **Separate your business and personal money** — open a dedicated bank account or e-wallet
- **Set aside 8-10% of every payment** into a "tax fund" so you're never caught off guard
- **Consider hiring a CPA** once your income is consistent — they can save you money and stress
- **File on time** — penalties and surcharges add up fast

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- Thinking you're "too small" to register — the BIR doesn't have a minimum
- Mixing personal and business expenses
- Not filing quarterly returns (even if you have no income that quarter)
- Ignoring withholding tax certificates from brands — these are tax credits you can use

## Bottom Line

Paying taxes as a creator isn't as scary as it sounds. Register early, pick the right tax option for your situation, and set aside money regularly. Your future self will thank you.
