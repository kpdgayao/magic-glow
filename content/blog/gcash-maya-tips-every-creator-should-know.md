# GCash and Maya Tips Every Creator Should Know

GCash and Maya aren't just for sending money anymore. For Filipino creators, they're essential business tools — from receiving brand deal payments to saving and investing. Here are tips to get the most out of both.

## GCash Tips for Creators

### 1. Verify to the Highest Level

A fully verified GCash account gives you:
- Higher transaction and wallet limits (up to ₱500,000)
- Ability to receive larger brand deal payments
- Access to GCash savings and investment features

### 2. Use GSave for Emergency Funds

GSave is powered by CIMB Bank and earns around 2.6% interest per year. It's PDIC-insured and separates your savings from your spending wallet.

**Pro tip:** Set up automatic transfers to GSave every time you receive a payment. Even ₱200 per transaction adds up.

### 3. GCash Investment Features

- **GInvest** — Access UITFs (mutual fund-like products) with as little as ₱50
- **GStocks** — Trade stocks through GCash (powered by GCash Invest)
- **GInsure** — Affordable insurance products

### 4. Track Your Transactions

GCash has a built-in transaction history. Export it monthly to track your income. But don't rely solely on it — some transactions may not be labeled clearly. Log brand deal payments in MoneyGlow's income tracker for better records.

### 5. GCash for Paying Taxes

You can pay BIR taxes through GCash's "Pay Bills" feature under Government. Search for BIR and enter your payment details. This saves you a trip to the bank.

### 6. Maximize Cashback

GCash regularly offers cashback and rewards through:
- GCash Deals (discount vouchers)
- GLife cashback promos
- Bank transfer fee waivers (occasional promos)

Check the promos section regularly — small cashbacks add up over time.

## Maya Tips for Creators

### 1. Maya Savings Account

Maya's savings account offers competitive interest rates (up to 3.5% p.a.), higher than most traditional banks. It's a solid option for parking your emergency fund.

### 2. Maya for QR Payments

Maya's QR payment system works with most merchants. If you have business expenses (props, equipment, food for shoots), using Maya earns you cashback on eligible purchases.

### 3. Maya Business Account

If you're earning consistently from content creation, consider a Maya Business account:
- Professional payment link for brand invoices
- Transaction analytics
- Business-grade support

### 4. Maya Crypto

Maya offers cryptocurrency trading. While we don't recommend crypto for emergency funds, if you're interested in learning, Maya provides a regulated platform. Only invest money you can afford to lose.

### 5. Pay Bills and Government Contributions

Through Maya, you can pay:
- BIR taxes
- SSS contributions
- Pag-IBIG contributions
- PhilHealth premiums
- Utility bills

Set reminders to pay your government contributions on time — these are important for your future benefits.

## GCash vs Maya: Quick Comparison

| Feature | GCash | Maya |
|---------|-------|------|
| User base | Larger (90M+) | Growing fast |
| Savings rate | ~2.6% (GSave) | ~3.5% |
| Crypto trading | Yes (GCrypto) | Yes (Maya Crypto) |
| Investments | GInvest, GStocks, GCrypto | Maya Crypto |
| Bill payments | Extensive | Extensive |
| Business features | GCash for Business | Maya Business |
| Insurance | GInsure | Limited |

## Best Practices for Both

### Separate Business and Personal

Create a system:
- **Primary wallet** → Personal spending
- **Savings feature** (GSave / Maya Savings) → Emergency fund
- **Log all brand payments** → MoneyGlow tracker

### Set Up Security

- Enable biometric/face login
- Set transaction PINs different from your phone password
- Enable SMS/email notifications for all transactions
- Never share your MPIN with anyone
- Be wary of GCash/Maya phishing texts

### Watch Out for Fees

Both platforms charge fees for certain transactions:
- Cash-in via some banks: Free
- Cash-out to bank: Usually ₱15-₱25
- Send money to another wallet: Usually free (promos) or ₱10

These fees can add up if you're transferring money frequently. Plan your transfers to minimize fees.

## Pro Workflow for Creators

1. **Receive payment** → GCash or Maya (brand's preference)
2. **Log it** → MoneyGlow income tracker (platform, type, amount)
3. **Set aside 8%** → Transfer to separate "tax fund" (GSave or Maya Savings)
4. **Set aside 20%** → Transfer to emergency/savings fund
5. **Remaining 72%** → Your budget (50/30/20 from this portion)

## One More Thing

Both GCash and Maya offer referral programs. As a content creator, you can earn by sharing your referral link with your audience (just disclose it's a referral link). It's a legitimate way to earn a little extra from platforms you already use.
