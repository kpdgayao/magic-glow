# Brand Deal Pricing Guide for Filipino Creators

"How much should I charge?" It's the most common question Filipino creators ask — and the hardest to answer because there's no single right number. But there are frameworks to help you price confidently.

## Why Pricing Matters

Undercharging hurts the entire creator economy. When you accept ₱500 for a post that should cost ₱5,000, you're not just undervaluing yourself — you're setting expectations that hurt other creators too.

On the flip side, overcharging without the metrics to back it up means fewer deals. The sweet spot is pricing based on your actual value.

## The Basic Formula

A common starting point:

**Base Rate = (Followers / 1000) × ₱100-₱500**

The multiplier depends on your engagement rate:

| Engagement Rate | Multiplier |
|----------------|-----------|
| Below 1% | ₱100/1K |
| 1-3% | ₱200/1K |
| 3-5% | ₱350/1K |
| Above 5% | ₱500/1K |

**Example:** 50K followers with 4% engagement = 50 × ₱350 = ₱17,500

But this is just a starting point. Many factors adjust this number up or down.

## Factors That Increase Your Rate

- **Niche expertise** — Finance, tech, and health creators can charge more
- **High engagement rate** — Brands care more about engagement than follower count
- **Video content** — TikTok/Reels/YouTube content costs more than static posts
- **Usage rights** — If the brand wants to use your content in their ads, charge extra
- **Exclusivity** — If they want you to not work with competitors, that's premium
- **Deliverables** — More posts/stories/videos = higher total rate

## Platform-Specific Pricing Guidelines

### TikTok

| Followers | Estimated Rate |
|-----------|---------------|
| 1K-10K | ₱1,000-₱5,000 |
| 10K-50K | ₱5,000-₱20,000 |
| 50K-100K | ₱20,000-₱50,000 |
| 100K-500K | ₱50,000-₱150,000 |
| 500K+ | ₱150,000+ |

### Instagram

| Followers | Feed Post | Story Set (3) |
|-----------|----------|--------------|
| 1K-10K | ₱1,500-₱5,000 | ₱1,000-₱3,000 |
| 10K-50K | ₱5,000-₱25,000 | ₱3,000-₱10,000 |
| 50K-100K | ₱25,000-₱60,000 | ₱10,000-₱25,000 |

### YouTube

YouTube rates are typically 2-5x higher than other platforms due to longer content format and longer content lifespan:

| Subscribers | Dedicated Video | Integration |
|------------|----------------|-------------|
| 1K-10K | ₱5,000-₱15,000 | ₱3,000-₱8,000 |
| 10K-50K | ₱15,000-₱50,000 | ₱8,000-₱25,000 |
| 50K-100K | ₱50,000-₱150,000 | ₱25,000-₱60,000 |

*These are estimates based on the Philippine market. Actual rates vary by niche and campaign.*

## How to Negotiate

### Step 1: Ask for Their Budget First

"Thanks for reaching out! I'd love to learn more about the campaign. Could you share the budget range you're working with?"

This prevents you from accidentally underbidding.

### Step 2: Present a Package, Not a Price

Instead of "₱10,000 for one post," offer:

**Package A** — 1 TikTok video + 3 stories: ₱15,000
**Package B** — 1 TikTok + 1 IG Reel + 3 stories: ₱25,000
**Package C** — Full campaign (3 TikToks + IG + Stories + usage rights): ₱50,000

### Step 3: Know Your Walk-Away Number

Before any negotiation, decide the minimum you'll accept. If they go below it, politely decline. There will always be more opportunities.

### Step 4: Get Everything in Writing

Always have a simple contract or at least an email confirmation covering:
- Deliverables (what you'll create)
- Timeline (when content goes live)
- Payment terms (amount, when, how)
- Usage rights (where they can use your content)
- Revision limits (how many edits included)

## Common Pricing Mistakes

1. **Accepting product-only deals when you need income** — Products are nice but they don't pay rent
2. **Not charging for revisions** — Include 1-2 revisions in your rate, then charge for additional ones
3. **Forgetting about content creation costs** — Your time, equipment, editing software, and props all cost money
4. **Not factoring in taxes** — If you charge ₱10,000, remember ~8% goes to taxes
5. **Comparing yourself to mega-influencers** — Focus on your own metrics and growth

## Build Your Rate Card

Create a simple one-page rate card with your:
- Platform stats (followers, engagement rate, demographics)
- Content types and base rates
- Package options
- Contact information

This makes you look professional and saves negotiation time.
