# How to Spot Investment Scams on Social Media

"Invest ₱5,000 today, get ₱50,000 in 30 days!" If you've seen posts like this on TikTok or Facebook, congratulations — you've encountered a scam. And they're everywhere.

Filipino content creators are frequent targets because scammers know you're earning money online and looking for ways to grow it. Here's how to protect yourself.

## The Most Common Scam Types

### 1. Ponzi / Pyramid Schemes

How they work: Early investors get paid using money from new investors. Eventually the scheme collapses and most people lose everything.

**Red flags:**
- "Guaranteed" high returns (20-50% per month)
- Earn more by recruiting others
- Vague about what the actual business or investment is
- Pressure to invest quickly ("limited slots!")

**Recent examples in PH:** Kapa Community Ministry, Rigen Marketing

### 2. Fake Forex / Crypto Trading Groups

How they work: You join a "trading group" and deposit money into a platform. They show you fake profits. When you try to withdraw, they ask for more fees, then disappear.

**Red flags:**
- Unregulated trading platforms (not SEC-registered)
- Screenshots of "profits" with no verifiable track record
- Admin/coach asks you to deposit more to "unlock" withdrawals
- Slick but unfamiliar platform interfaces

### 3. Money Game Apps

How they work: App pays you for tasks (watching videos, clicking ads), then requires you to "invest" to earn more. Pays out initially, then stops.

**Red flags:**
- Too-good-to-be-true task payments
- Requires topping up your "wallet" to keep earning
- App not in official app stores, or removed frequently
- Payments dry up after a few weeks

### 4. Fake Brand Deal Scams

How they work: Someone pretending to be a brand offers a paid collab. They send a fake check or overpayment, then ask you to "return the difference."

**Red flags:**
- Brand emails from Gmail/Yahoo instead of company domain
- Asks for upfront payment or personal financial details
- Overpays and asks for refund of excess
- Too eager, no proper contract or briefing

## The Golden Rules

### Rule 1: If It Sounds Too Good to Be True, It Is

No legitimate investment guarantees 10%+ monthly returns. The stock market averages 8-12% **per year**. Anyone promising more is either lying or running a scam.

### Rule 2: Check SEC Registration

Before investing in anything, search the company on the **SEC's Investment Check** website or the **SEC Advisory** list. If they're not registered, don't invest.

- SEC Advisory List: search "SEC Philippines investor alert"
- BSP and IC also maintain warning lists

### Rule 3: Never Invest What You Can't Afford to Lose

If losing the money would affect your ability to pay rent or eat, it's not money you should be investing — let alone in a sketchy opportunity.

### Rule 4: Take Your Time

Scammers create urgency. "Only 10 slots left!" "Price goes up tomorrow!" Legitimate investments don't disappear overnight. Take a day to research before sending money.

### Rule 5: Ask for Proof

- Ask for SEC registration numbers
- Ask for audited financial statements
- Ask for a physical office address
- Ask to meet in person

Legit companies will provide all of these. Scammers will dodge or get aggressive.

## What to Do If You've Been Scammed

1. **Stop sending money immediately** — Don't fall for "pay more to unlock your funds"
2. **Document everything** — Screenshots of conversations, transactions, receipts
3. **Report to authorities:**
   - SEC: sec.gov.ph
   - NBI Cybercrime Division
   - PNP Anti-Cybercrime Group
   - Your bank or e-wallet provider
4. **Warn others** — Share your experience to protect your community

## Safe Alternatives for Growing Your Money

Instead of get-rich-quick schemes, consider these legitimate options:

- **Digital bank savings** — 3-5% interest, PDIC insured
- **Pag-IBIG MP2** — Historically 6-7% annual dividends
- **Government bonds (RTBs)** — Low risk, decent returns
- **UITF / Mutual funds** — For long-term growth (SEC-regulated)
- **SSS voluntary contribution** — Increases your future pension

## Protect Your Community

As a content creator, you have influence. If you spot a scam, call it out. Share this guide. Help your followers avoid losing their hard-earned money. That's the real glow-up.
