# How to Track Your Creator Income Like a Pro

"May pumasok sa GCash ko, di ko na alam saan galing." Sound familiar? Many Filipino creators have money coming in from multiple sources — brand deals, affiliate commissions, ad revenue, tips — and lose track of what they're actually earning.

Tracking your income isn't just for tax filing. It helps you understand which platforms are worth your time, predict future earnings, and negotiate better brand deals.

## Why Most Creators Don't Track Income

- Money comes from too many places (GCash, Maya, bank transfer, PayPal)
- Payments are irregular (brand deals pay weeks or months later)
- Small amounts feel "not worth tracking" (but they add up!)
- No simple system that works for creators

## What to Track

For every payment you receive, record:

1. **Platform** — Where did the income come from? (TikTok, YouTube, Instagram, etc.)
2. **Type** — What kind of income? (Brand deal, affiliate, ad revenue, tips, freelance)
3. **Amount** — How much in pesos? (Convert if received in USD)
4. **Date** — When did you receive it?
5. **Notes** — Any details (brand name, campaign, invoice number)

## Gross vs Net: Track Both

This is important and often overlooked:

- **Gross income** — The full amount before deductions (this is what brands pay you)
- **Net income** — What you actually receive after platform fees, taxes withheld, or payment processing fees

Example: A brand pays you ₱10,000 for a TikTok post, but the agency withholds 2% (₱200) for expanded withholding tax. Your gross is ₱10,000, your net is ₱9,800.

Track the **gross** amount for tax purposes, and note any deductions.

## Setting Up Your Tracking System

### Option 1: MoneyGlow Income Tracker

The easiest option for Filipino creators. MoneyGlow's tracker lets you:

- Log income by platform and type with a few taps
- See monthly totals and platform breakdowns
- Filter by month to match budget periods
- Automatically link tracked income to your budget

### Option 2: Simple Spreadsheet

If you prefer a spreadsheet, create columns for: Date, Platform, Type, Gross Amount, Fees/Deductions, Net Amount, Notes.

### Option 3: Screenshot + Log

At minimum, screenshot every payment notification and log it weekly. Better than nothing!

## Monthly Review: The 15-Minute Habit

At the end of every month, spend 15 minutes reviewing:

1. **Total income** — Is it trending up or down?
2. **Income by platform** — Which platform earns you the most per hour of effort?
3. **Income by type** — Are brand deals growing? Is affiliate income consistent?
4. **Missing payments** — Did any brands or platforms not pay on time?

This review helps you make strategic decisions: double down on what works, drop what doesn't.

## Pro Tips

- **Invoice every brand deal** — Even if they don't ask. It protects you and looks professional
- **Set payment terms** — 50% upfront for brand deals over ₱20,000
- **Build a rate card** — Know your worth based on your actual engagement data
- **Track time spent** — Divide income by hours to find your true hourly rate
- **Save for taxes** — Set aside 8-10% of every payment into a separate tax fund

## Start Small

You don't need a perfect system on day one. Start by logging every payment you receive this month. Once you have one month of data, you'll already see patterns you never noticed before.
