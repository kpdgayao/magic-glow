# The 50/30/20 Budget Rule for Irregular Income

The 50/30/20 rule is one of the simplest budgeting frameworks out there. But if you're a content creator with irregular income, you might wonder: how do I budget when I don't know how much I'll earn next month?

Good news — it still works. You just need to adapt it.

## What Is the 50/30/20 Rule?

Split your income into three buckets:

- **50% Needs** — Rent, food, utilities, transportation, internet, insurance
- **30% Wants** — Shopping, eating out, streaming subscriptions, barkada hangouts
- **20% Savings** — Emergency fund, investments, Pag-IBIG MP2, digital bank savings

## The Problem with Irregular Income

As a creator, your income might look like this:

- January: ₱8,000
- February: ₱25,000 (big brand deal!)
- March: ₱5,000

If you budget based on your best month, you'll overspend on lean months. If you budget based on your worst month, you'll miss opportunities to save more.

## How to Adapt 50/30/20 for Irregular Income

### Step 1: Calculate Your Baseline

Look at your last 3-6 months of income. Take the **lowest** amount — that's your baseline budget. Everything above that is bonus income.

Example: If your last 6 months were ₱8K, ₱12K, ₱25K, ₱5K, ₱15K, ₱10K — your baseline is ₱5,000.

### Step 2: Budget Your Baseline at 50/30/20

- Needs: ₱2,500
- Wants: ₱1,500
- Savings: ₱1,000

This is your "guaranteed" budget that works even in slow months.

### Step 3: Create Rules for Bonus Income

When you earn above your baseline, allocate the extra:

- **60% to savings/investments** — This is how you build wealth during good months
- **20% to needs** — Catch up on anything you skipped during lean months
- **20% to wants** — Reward yourself! You earned it

### Step 4: Build a Buffer Account

Before anything else, build a 1-month expense buffer. This means saving enough to cover one full month of needs (your 50% baseline). This buffer protects you when payments are delayed or months are slow.

## Real Example

Let's say your baseline is ₱10,000/month and you earn ₱30,000 this month:

**Baseline budget (₱10,000):**
- Needs: ₱5,000
- Wants: ₱3,000
- Savings: ₱2,000

**Bonus income (₱20,000):**
- Extra savings: ₱12,000
- Extra needs: ₱4,000
- Extra wants: ₱4,000

**Total savings this month: ₱14,000!** That's 47% of your income — way better than a flat 20%.

## Tips for Budgeting with Irregular Income

- **Track every peso** — Use MoneyGlow's income tracker to log all earnings by platform
- **Don't lifestyle-inflate** — When you have a big month, don't immediately upgrade your spending
- **Pay yourself a salary** — Transfer a fixed amount to your spending account monthly, keep the rest in savings
- **Review monthly** — Check your actual spending vs budget at the end of each month
- **Use the MoneyGlow budget page** — It automatically tracks your expenses against your 50/30/20 allocation

## What If 50/30/20 Doesn't Fit?

Not everyone's needs fit into 50%. Here are alternatives:

- **70/20/10** — If you're still a student or living with family (lower needs)
- **60/20/20** — If your living expenses are high (Manila rent, anyone?)
- **40/30/30** — If you have debt to pay off (30% to debt repayment)

The key isn't the exact percentages — it's having a system and sticking to it.

## Start Today

You don't need to earn a lot to start budgeting. Even ₱5,000/month is enough to practice the 50/30/20 split. The habit you build now will serve you when you're earning ₱50,000 or ₱500,000.
